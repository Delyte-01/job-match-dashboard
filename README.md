# Job Match Dashboard

## 🚀 Project Overview
The **Job Match Dashboard** is a Next.js and TypeScript-based web application that helps users find jobs based on their skills. The app fetches job listings from an API and calculates a match score, allowing users to apply for jobs that best suit their skills.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Next.js** – For server-side rendering and routing.
- **TypeScript** – For type safety and better developer experience.
- **React Context API** – For managing user state globally.
- **Mock API** – Fetching job listings dynamically.
- **ShadCN UI Components** – For UI elements like buttons and progress bars.

## 🎯 Features
- **User Profile Management** – Uses Context API to store user data.
- **Dynamic Job Matching** – Compares user's skills with job requirements.
- **Progress Indicator** – Displays how well a user matches a job.
- **Apply or Upskill Alert** – Users can either apply or see suggestions to improve skills.
- **Dynamic Routing** – Uses Next.js dynamic pages for job details.
